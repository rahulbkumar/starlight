# CURRENTLY STILL BUILDING

# Introduction:
Starlight is a chrome extension inspired by Daylight Computers vision and UI. Sunnie and I loved the Daylights focus on building humane technology that respects health, attention, and freedom. Inspired, we wanted to create a simple chrome extension that does the same, giving birth to Starlight!

# Features:
1. Task list to brain dump all those tasks you should probably start working on!
1. Pomodoro timer to help you *lock in* and focus on those tasks!
2. Website blockers to stop the *doomscrolling* and *brainrot*!
